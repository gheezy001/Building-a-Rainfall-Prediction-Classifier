# Building-a-Rainfall-Prediction-Classifier
In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills learned in this course to build a machine learning classifier that predicts rainfall based on historical weather data of Australia.

# Objectives
Explore and perform feature engineering on the weather data
Build a classifier pipeline and optimize it using grid search cross validation
Evaluate your model by interpreting various performance metrics and visualizations
Implement a different classifier by updating your pipeline
Use an appropriate set of parameters to search over in each case
